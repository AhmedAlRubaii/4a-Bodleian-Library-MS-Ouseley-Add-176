    "description":"The Shahnama, translated as \"Book of Kings\", is a collection of stories and retellings of pre-Islamic Persian stories of glory and kingship, with strong ties to the Zoroastrian belief and with the supernatural. It was written by Abul-Qasim Firdawsi around 1010 AD, is a book containing over 60000 verses of stories and epics that pertain to the history of Persia. Although there are no surviving manuscripts from Firdawsi’s time, there are some from around the 13th to 15th centuries (Watson,2018)."},

    "description":"Ibrahim Sultan, born 26 August 1394, in modern day turkey, was the grandson of Timur. In his 20s, he followed in his fathers and grandfather’s footsteps and became the ruler of Shiraz in modern day Iran, for which he ruled until his death in 1435. During his rule, he commissioned a copy of the Shahnama in his name for which he would be the patron of. Similarly, his brothers, Muhammed Juki and Baysunghur were also patrons of their respective Shahnama manuscripts. There is not much information known as to why Ibrahim Sultan and his brothers had Shahnama commissions, but it is well known that commissioning a great work of literature, with such deep ties to Persian history and Zoroastrianism, implies that the patron himself embraces the values within and the workmanship of the previous writers, authors, and illustrators. By doing so, they would be known for their appreciation of the fine arts and the effort that goes into creating them, things that were highly valued at that time. Furthermore, by being patrons of such works of literature, they could have also benefited from links to religious beliefs which would line up with Persian religious traditions (Far, 2003). It is also important to note that Ibrahim Sultan was a competent calligrapher himself, having several copies of the Quran to his name as well as his inscriptions on buildings in Shiraz, Iran.

    "description":"Like Baysunghur, Ibrahim Sultan’s Shahnama has a preface which is not a part of the original stories of the Shahnama. There is some confusion as to which of the two brothers decided to add a preface to their Shahnama first as there are elements in one that seem to be copies from the other and vice versa. Regardless of that, the preface of Ibrahim Sultan’s Shahnama focuses on him and his princely actions, further emphasizing him as a traditional Iranian monarch (Abdullaeva and Melville, 2008, 48-49). Folio 4r falls within this preface and therefore has no relation to any of the Shahnama stories, but only on Sultan’s life experiences (Watson,2018). This folio is also one of the multiple double-page portraits in the manuscript, which for future copies became a common feature. The manuscript is very well decorated and ornamented, one fit for the grandson of Timur and the ruler of Shiraz. The manuscript was decorated with traditional Shirazi gold styling and lush floral design. It is also noted that the manuscript was subject to some water damage during its lifetime, most of which was to the folios, and most of which was repaired. (ULUÇ, 2013)"},

    "description":"Unfortunately, there is little context to what exactly is happening or what is depicted in this folio, and all that is written next are just assumptions based on observation. Most or almost all the figures within the folio are men. This cannot be said with certainty because the original folio seems to have been damaged on the top left area, making it difficult to confidently assume that the two figures depicted are indeed men. Assuming that those two figures are indeed men, then almost all the figures within the folio are looking to the right and seem to have their head bowing down. Five of the men are also on their knees, two on the ground and three on a carpet/mat. The way the men are depicted in this folio gives a melancholy effect, and makes the looker almost assume that some sort of tragedy has taken place or that someone important and dear has passed away. The light blue, almost grey ground further accentuates the point. Moreover, the plant/ bush in the middle of the folio, along with the other plants seen within, are not as bright, vibrant, and contrasted with the background as with some of the other folios. It can also be seen that on the top right what could be the coffin of the deceased person as there is a sword that is resting upon the coffin, possibly symbolising that the deceased person was a warrior. Although this can be an interpretation, it is somewhat unlikely since the 3 men on the carpet would be bowing their heads towards said coffin, and not to the right of the folio."},

    "description": "Sims notes that the presence of a preface in Ibrahim Sultan’s copy of the Shahnama might have been a response to Baysunghur’s copy since it also contained a preface and was completed prior to the creation of Sultan’s. He also notes that this copy of the Shahnama is the one with the most illustration out of the three grandsons of Timur. It is also notes that Sultan’s is also the most damaged copy of the three, stating that the use of the colour \"Timurid green\" which is produced from copper carbonate, has burned through some of the illustrations. Within this copy however, there are some illustrations that are double paged, most of which indicated him taking part in princely activities and holding court. This lines up with my folio (4r) which seems to be connected to folio 1v as they both share the same title and looking at them side-by-side, almost match up in every way. (Sims, 1992)"},
