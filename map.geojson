    "description":"\"The Shahnama, written by Abul-Qasim Firdawsi around 1010 AD, is a book containing over 60000 verses of stories and epics that pertain to the history of Persia. Although there are no surviving manuscripts from Firdawsi’s time, there are some from around the 13th to 15th centuries. Each grandson of Timur had a copy of the Shahnama made for them. One grandson, Ibrahim Sultan, has his own copy and is the patron of this copy of the Shahnama. For Ibrahim Sutlan’s copy, there is a preface that documents his story and his life before the start of the original Shahnama writings. Folio 4r falls within this preface and therefore has no relation to any of the Shahnama stories, but only on Sultan’s life experiences (Watson,2018).\" (Hebert & Dempsey)"},

Most or almost all of the figures within the folio are men. This cannot be said with certainty because the original folio seems to have been damaged on the top left area, making it difficult to confidently assume that the two figures depicted are indeed men.\""},

Five of the men are also on their knees, two on the ground and three on a carpet/mat. The way the men are depicted in this folio gives a melancholy effect, and makes the looker almost assume that some sort of tragedy has taken place or that someone important and dear has passed away. \""},
